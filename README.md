Test task for Eugene

## Getting Started
Developed for flutter v.3.7.1 stable
For launch navigate to lib/server/ and execute there dart run.
When server is running you can launch an app. Entrypoint of an app lies /lib/main.dart
Remember each session of server contains local data, so you need to signUp first.
I know i should add some error indications and navigation buttons but i will do it next time.
for the demonstration autofill with examples of login and password enabled.
This works only with emulator, if you want to launch this on physical device you should modify /lib/utils/network/network.dart and set _serverAddress to localhost instead of emulators localhost mask
